1. Make sure you have Python3 installed. (The version I used for development is 3.9.1)
2. Install all dependencies with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Run server with 'python manage.py runserver'
4. Open 'http://localhost:8000' in your browser


NOTE:
In case of any issues with step 3, run 'python manage.py makemigrations' and 'python manage.py migrate' and try again.
